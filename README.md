## 👋 About Me  
I am a passionate AI Engineer with a strong focus on **Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, AI Policy, and Computational Social Science**. My work revolves around developing innovative AI-driven solutions that address real-world challenges, from improving productivity to promoting inclusivity in AI tools. I am deeply interested in the intersection of technology and society, particularly how AI can be used to create equitable and sustainable systems. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Engineering Artificial Intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am working on cutting-edge projects like the Irembo LLM Chatbot and Malaria Digitization. Additionally, I am a **Research Group Member at the Center for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP)**, where I contribute to global AI policy frameworks and human rights initiatives
